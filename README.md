# sndcpy (tweaked version)
This is tweaked version of original by rom1v. This fork is designed specifically for the Lizumi SXM project to record and play audio from an android device, making it a IP radio for Sirius XM

This version has some features:
- Support changing sampling rate and buffer size
- Show sampling rate in notification
- Automatically restart on socket disconnect
- Log when socket is ready and when it's restarting.
- Dual Sockets for Recording and Playback without a proxy 

## Changing sampling rate
To change sampling rate, add to `am` command with `--ei SAMPLE_RATE FREQ` option.
(e.g. 88.2kHz)
```
adb shell am start com.rom1v.sndcpy/.MainActivity --ei SAMPLE_RATE 88200
```

## Changing buffer size
Buffer size options are available 5 types:
- 0: Normal (1024*1024 bytes)
- 1: Smaller (1024*512 bytes)
- 2: Small (1024*256 bytes)
- 3: Very small (1024*128 bytes)
- 4: Super small (1024*64 bytes)
Warning: decrease buffer size may make audio choppy.

To change buffer size, add to `am` command with `--ei BUFFER_SIZE_TYPE NUM` option.
```
am start com.rom1v.sndcpy/.MainActivity --ei SAMPLE_RATE 48000 --ei BUFFER_SIZE_TYPE 3
```

## Relay Server
Relay servers allow multiple connections to the sndcpy server.

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+

Usage:
1. Install sndcpy apk
2. Run `start_sndcpy_relay.bat` or `start_sndcpy_relay.sh`
3. Connect localhost:28201 via FFplay, mpv etc. (when default settings. Sampling rate depends your settings)

Parameters:
All parameters are optional.

- `--sndcpy-host HOSTNAME`
  sndcpy's hostname (default: `localhost`)
- `--sndcpy-port PORT`
  sndcpy's forwarding port (default: `28200`)
- `--bind ADDR`
  Address to listen relay server (e.g. `0.0.0.0` allows you to connect in LAN networks) (default: `localhost`)
- `--port PORT`
  Port to listen relay server (default: `28201`)
